# hdMLP
## A Powerful Multi-Layer Perceptron 
This easy-to-use library includes all advanced training methods, with tensor format. Large amount of network can be achieved by using this library including Sparse Autoencoder, Denosing Autoencoder, Rectifier Pre-train and so on. However, you should contact author before using this library.

 
### Training Methods:
> 1. Greedy Layer-Wise Pre-train
> 2. Fine-Tune
> 3. Dropout
> 4. Autoencoder (AE)
> 5. Regression & Classification
> 6. Apache Spark
> 7. GPU Acceleration

### Activation Functions:
> 1. Rectifier	(if pre-train: reconstruction layer will be softplus)
> 2. Sigmoid		(if pre-train: reconstruction layer will be sigmoid)
> 3. Ramp Sigmoid  (if pre-train: reconstruction layer will be sigmoid)
> 4. All Others
